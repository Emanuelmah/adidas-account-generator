# adidas-account-generator

An Adidas.com account generator that creates accounts without requiring a captcha harvester of any sort (manual captcha harvesting, 2captcha, or anti-captcha).
*Exports account info to a .txt file ```createdaccounts.txt```
* NOTE: This currently does not support proxies. In an effort to not get softbanned by adidas, it it not threaded. The code is there for proxy and threading but it's still buggy and in development. Feel free to contribute. If you put proxies into the file it will automatically use them and start threading (untested).
* Proxies can be ip or user/pass verified.
